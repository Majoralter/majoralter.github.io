Thinking back now, I really think this is what helped me perform well in school, and this principle of having a routine and sticking to it applies to every other aspect of life.",[11,18,19],{},"Routines can be very simple: game/movie nights on Fridays with your friends, coding/designing for three hours every day, playing football every Saturday, reading ten chapters of a book every day, etc.",[11,21,22],{},"Doing these things gives you clarity on how you want to spend your time each day and, in turn, makes each day feel productive.
